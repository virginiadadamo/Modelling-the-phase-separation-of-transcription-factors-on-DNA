# Modelling the phase separation of transcription factors on DNA
 The overall goal of this project is to predict the distribution of sizes of the condensed phase of a transcription factor (TF) on a linear strand of DNA both without and in the presence of a polymeric intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). The TF, which we call protein A, has non-specific binding to DNA domains, and is able also to bind to itself. The IDP, which we refer to as protein B, has k binding sites for the A proteins, and acts as a platform for binding multiple A molecules. There are three energy scales in the problem, representing: A-DNA binding, A-A binding, A-B binding. Together with the concentrations of A and B, and k, the model has six parameters, which is too large for brute force simulations. The project will initially focus on reducing the parameter space, and constructing a dynamical model(s) of the cluster growth. Next, Monte Carlo simulations will be used to explore the modelâ€™s predictions. Additionally, we will attempt to build a statistical mechanical model that describes the problem, and compare its predictions with the simulations.
