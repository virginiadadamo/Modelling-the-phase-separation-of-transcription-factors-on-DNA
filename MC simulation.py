#Set Up the Parameters

#Generate Random Variables

'''
Use NumPy to generate random variables that represent the uncertainty in your model.

For stock prices, these could be the daily returns:
daily_returns = np.random.normal(avg_daily_return, std_deviation, number_of_days)
'''

#Run the Simulation

'''
Iterate the process for as many simulations as you need.

Each iteration represents a possible future scenario:

for i in range(number_of_simulations):
 '''

#Analyze the Results
'''
Once you have the simulation data, you can analyze it to draw conclusions.

This might include plotting a histogram of the final stock prices or calculating the Value at Risk (VaR).

Visualization
Use Matplotlib to visualize the results. This can help in understanding the distribution of outcomes:

plt.hist(final_prices, bins=50)
plt.show()
